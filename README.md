or you can _clone_ it to a local computer. The command

```bash
git clone git@github.com:E2-PhD-Council/ThesisTemplate.git ThesisTemplate
```

2. Just getting the files

In the [releases](https://github.com/E2-PhD-Council/ThesisTemplate/releases) tab, you can access all released versions of the template.

3. Overleaf template

The template is available with the name `TODO: ADD NAME`.



## Usage
The main file of the thesis is `Thesis.tex`, which initiate the template files.
No changes should be made to this file, it is just for easy access.

The only files that should be changed are contained within the folder `YourThesis`.

When creating a new thesis, start with `YourThesis/Config.tex` to set up all the general information.

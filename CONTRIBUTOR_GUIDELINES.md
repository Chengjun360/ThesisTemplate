## Submit pull request

### Checklist before submit
- Make sure that your version of the code compiles without errors or warnings.
Preferably on multiple platforms (pdflatex, Overleaf, et c.)
- Avoid if possible to make changes in the `YourThesis` directory.

### Review
Any pull request will undergo a review from one of the maintainers listed in the `thesis-template` team.

We will do this as quickly as possible, but keep in mind that this is a voluntary side-project for us.

### License

Your contributions must be shared under the same license as that of this repo (MIT).

## Update version on overleaf

There is an overleaf document synced with this repo.
The workflow is to never do any actual changes in the Overleaf document,
but rather only pull in changes from the github repo.

This can of course only be done by people with write permissions for the Overleaf document,
and the following instructions are only relevant to them.

When changes have been pulled, submit a new version as a template,
following this guide [this guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_update_a_template,_example_or_article_I%27ve_published_in_the_Overleaf_gallery%3F).

According to [this note](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_update_a_template,_example_or_article_I%27ve_published_in_the_Overleaf_gallery%3F).
there is no version handling; the template is over-written on re-submit.

In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, would like to thank Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons, for bringing peace in Westeros.

This peace would not have been possible without the help of Lady Olenna of the House Tyrell, Prince Oberyn of House Martell, Lord Tyrion of House Lannister and Jon Snow the late prince of Dragonstone.
A special mention to Ser Davos of House Seaworth and Lady Lyanna of House Mormont.
